# Alzheimer-Classification-using-ResNet

This repository contains an implementation of **Alzheimer‚Äôs disease stage classification** using a ResNet-based deep learning model.  
The model was trained and evaluated on MRI brain scan images, with the goal of distinguishing between different stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

## üìå Problem Statement
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognition.  
Early and accurate detection of its stages can help clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.  

This project was developed as a part of **IEEE EMBS Internship** program.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
**[Alzheimer‚Äôs Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanaadlimaye/alzheimers-classification-datase)**  

Initially the dataset was uploaded to Roboflow, where, the Preprocessing steps and Image Augmentations were performed.

- Images are categorized into four classes:
  - **MD**: Mild Demented  
  - **MoD**: Moderate Demented  
  - **ND**: Non Demented  
  - **VMD**: Very Mild Demented  

The dataset was split into:
- **Training set**
- **Validation set**
- **Test set**

CSV files provided contain filenames and one-hot encoded class labels.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded CSV files for train/validation/test splits.
   - Converted one-hot encodings into class labels.
   - Applied **image preprocessing and augmentation**:
     - Resize to 224√ó224
     - Horizontal/vertical flips
     - Rotation (¬±15¬∞)
     - Normalization

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Used **ResNet** (transfer learning) with pre-trained ImageNet weights.
   - Added fully-connected layers with **Dropout** for regularization.
   - Final softmax layer for 4-class classification.

3. **Training**
   - GPU: T4 x 2 (Kaggle Notebooks)
   - Optimizer: `Adam`  
   - Loss: `categorical_crossentropy`  
   - Batch size: 32  
   - EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks used.
  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy & Loss curves for train/validation.
   - Test set evaluation for generalization.
   - Classification report & confusion matrix.(F1 score, Precision, Recall) 

---

## üìä Results
- **Training Accuracy**: ~97%  
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~93%  
- **Test Accuracy**: ~94%  
- **Test Loss**: ~0.22  

The results indicate the model generalizes well with minimal overfitting.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows class-level predictions and misclassifications.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, F1-score for each class.

## üíª How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Alzheimer-Stage-Detection-ResNet.git
   cd Alzheimer-Stage-Detection-ResNet
2. Create a virtual environment with python version == 3.10 (since tensorflow and keras version conflicts with the newer Python 3.13).
   ```bash
   cd Alzheimer-Classification-using-ResNet
   python3.10 -m venv venv310
3. For Anaconda users - create a conda environment with the python version as 3.10 (same reason as stated above).
   ```bash
   conda create -n myEnv python=3.10
   conda activate myEnv
4. After the virtual environment is set, install the required dependencies as provided in the requirements.txt file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. When all the dependencies are installed, launch the Jupyter Notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Alzheimer-Detection-Resnet.ipynb
